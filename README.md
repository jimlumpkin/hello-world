# hello-world
hello-world example


I'm Jim Lumpkin, been programming for 30+ years and all the new stuff is, well, new to me :) ... 

I like learning new stuff and have been using docker and github for a while without really studying the basics.  It's time to go back to the start and learn some basics that I "sort of" understand but need a better understanding of in order to extend into creating docker images and using them.

God bless!  Jim
